  <title>Top 3 Movies</title>

  <h1>The Col√≥n Rewatchable Movie List</h1>
  <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>Drive</h3>
  <p>
    This movie influenced and rolemodeled some of my masculine ideals. <br />
    There is a certain masculine stoicism embodied by the main character, <br />
    who is nameless throughout the movie, and a desire to protect others. <br />
    There is also an appreciation for driving as a hobby and as an aesthetic. <br />
    I have watched this movie at least half a dozen times by now. <br />
  </p>
  <h3>Iron Giant</h3>
  <p>
    I first watched this movie as a young boy, and have since watched it several times. <br />
    This movie shows the meaning of sacrafice for those we love, <br />
    the importance of loyalty and brotherhood, <br />
    and that anyone is capable of changing themselves and their destiny, <br />
    regardless of who they were born as. <br />
  </p>
  <h3>They Live</h3>
  <p>
    This movie breaks the fourth wall of American culture. <br />
    It shows us what we are surrounded by but never see. <br />
    This movie is thought provoking and highlights the fact that we all can be and are influnced <br />
    in ways that may not be apparanent to us or anyone we know. <br />
